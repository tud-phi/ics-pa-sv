    "\n",
    "This task focuses on tuning the sequence of feedforward actions using PD-ILC to track a trajectory as well as possible. We assume the following scenario: for control purposes, we only have have access to a perturbed set of robot parameters. Specifically, the mass and inertia are increased with respect to the nominal robot model. Therefore, we observe a significant tracking error when using a PD + pure feedforward controller (see Task 2a.3) and simulating the closed-loop system using the nominal robot parameters. The purpose of applying ILC to this problem setting is to iteratively decrease this tracking error by tuning the feed-forward control action. It needs to be stressed that the controller never has access to the nominal dynamical model and thus the perturbed parameters are also used for the linearization of the system."

    "We model the trajectory to be discretized into $N$ time-steps, each of duration $\\delta t$. In the following we will conform to the super-vector / lifted system notation as introduced during the lectures: $\\theta_j(k) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ for example corresponds to the link angles at the $k$th time-step and at the $j$th ILC iteration. $Y_j \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2 (N-1)}$ describes the system output sequence in super-vector notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "But first, we need to implement a small utility function. Namely, `blk_diag` should take a stack of block matrices (i.e. a tensor of shape $(m, n, o)$, where $(n, o)$ is the block matrix) and place them along the diagonal of a matrix. This resulting block-diagonal matrix will then have the shape $(m \\: n, m \\: o)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise is a good opportunity to get familiar with the [`jax.lax.fori_loop`](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.lax.fori_loop.html) and [`jax.lax.dynamic_update_slice`](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.lax.dynamic_update_slice.html), which allow for jittable `for` loops and array _slicing_ respectively. This will make your function run significantly faster compared to naive, purely Pythonic implementation, which will come in handy later for Q-ILC."

Please note that you are **not** allowed to change these gains. Instead, please tune the PD-ILC gains, which are denoted with `kp_ilc` and `kd_ilc`, and the number of ILC iterations to achieve good tracking performance defined as **the Euclidean norm of the RMSE in operational-space being below 0.06 m.** The points are distributed as follows:\n",
